# Project Euler Solved using Ruby

This is my attempt to solve project euler problems. Currently, my language of choice is Ruby, but I might add more languages, as I get familiar with them. [This is a good place to visit, if you wanna know what am I upto.](http://www.newbiedev.com/p/hire-me.html)

### Instructions

```
cd project_euler
# Install required gems
bundle install

# To run the test
rspec
```

### Organization

Problems are stored inside lib directory while the specs for the problems are stored inside spec directory.
